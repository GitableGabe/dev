    <h3>Module 5</h3>

    <br />
    <b>Beginner:</b>
    <p>
        This is one of two homework assignments you can complete for this week (you must do two,
        you may do all three for extra credit). This is geared towards those of you who have never
        worked with javascript before.
        <br />
        Your assignment should be in the form of an HTML page, which I will be able to run locally.
        Refer to the file <i>'js_in_webpage.html'</i> on the
        <a href="https://github.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA_608/tree/master/module5">github page</a>
        for instructions on setting up javascript to run on an HTML page, and how to run/debug.
        You should complete both of these in 2 (or more) functions on one HTML page
    </p>
    <style>
        ol {
            font-weight: bolder;
        }

            ol li span {
                font-weight: normal;
            }
    </style>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>
                Create a function to reverse any word that you type in. This can be typed into either
                an input box or an alert box, and then print the result in a box or on the webpage.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
                Create a function that takes an input number, and prints a table with the first 20
                multiples of the number, in order 5x4
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
        type in 2 and it results in:
        <table>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>16</td></tr>
            <tr><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>22</td><td>24</td></tr>
            <tr><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>30</td><td>32</td></tr>
            <tr><td>34</td><td>36</td><td>38</td><td>40</td></tr>
        </table>
    </blockquote>


    <h2>Answer 1</h2>
    <br>

    <!-- start input box -->
    <p>Enter a word: </p>

    <p>
        <input type="text" id="word" />
    </p>
    <!-- end input box -->
    <!-- start button -->
    <p>
        <button id="btn">
            REVERSE
        </button>
    </p>
    <!-- end button -->
    <!-- start output-->
    <p>
        <output id="result" />
    </p>
    <!-- end output -->

    <script>

    // begin function
    function rev_str(){

        var x=document.getElementById("word").value;

      var y=  x.split("").reverse().join("");
    document.getElementById("result").innerText=y;

    }
    // end function

    // function call
        document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", rev_str);
    </script>

    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>
            Write a function to load the presidents.csv data and display the data as an html table
            (you may use a cdv parser from any available library, though I encourage you to try
            the d3 one).
        </li>
        <li>
            Now that you have the presidents data loaded, write a function that will return that
            president’s height & weight when you type it in. This can be typed into either an
            input box or an alert box, and then print the result in a box or on the webpage.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Deployment:</b> Your apps from parts 1 and 2 must be deployed. There are a lot of
        options for deploying javascript apps, however I would recommend using github pages.
